# Python_Pandas_Matplotlib_Project

This project aims to analyze the distribution of startup funding across various cities and industries in India. By examining data on funding amounts and locations, the project identifies key trends and insights that can inform investors, entrepreneurs, and policymakers about the landscape of startup investments.

Objectives

Data Cleaning and Standardization using pandas:
Ensure consistency in city names.
Handle missing values appropriately.
Convert funding amounts to a numeric format for accurate analysis.

City-wise Funding Analysis:
Calculate and rank the total funding received by startups in different cities.
Identify the top 10 cities by total funding and determine their share of the overall funding.

Industry-wise Funding Analysis:
Assess the distribution of funding across various industries.
Visualize the funding amounts for different industries to identify sector-wise investment patterns using matplotlib library.
